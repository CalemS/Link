Link - The Blockchain Filesharing Protocol

Link is a protocol designed to allow publishing of data and associated meta-data to the public in such a way that it cannot be censored or destroyed. It works on top of existing blockchain protocols to store it's data by embedding the information in the blockchain itself.

Link works by encoding messages into address, and then spending to those addresses. It's unlikely that a person could know the corsponding private key, so the coins are effectively destroyed. This makes blockchain bloat using the Link protocol prohibitivly expensive, while still allowing the free market to determine it's fair value.

Link specifies a specific format for creating transactions which conform to the Link protocol, and therefore can be indexed by clients. This makes Link suitible for inclusion in any blockchain, and allows anyone to implement a client which can parse Link formatted messages out of a blockchain.

Link describes how meta-data can be embedded along with the data, and how to store arbitrary amounts of data by linking transactions together in a sequence.
